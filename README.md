## Representation

MoCoGAN is a generative model for videos, which generates videos from random inputs. It features separated representations of motion and content, offering control over what is generated. For example, MoCoGAN can generate the same object performing different actions, as well as the same action performed by different objects

## Examples of generated videos

<!---
All videos in this section are generated by MoCoGAN.

We trained MoCoGAN on the [MUG Facial Expression Database](https://mug.ee.auth.gr/fed/) to generate facial expressions. When fixing the content code and changing the motion code, it generated the same person performs different expressions. When fixing the motion code and changing the content code, it generated different people performs the same expression. In the figure shown below, each column has fixed identity, each row shows the same action:

We trained MoCoGAN on a synthetically generated dataset of moving shapes. The color, shape and size of each moving shape represent content. Action is a specific motion direction. The shapes move bottom-top and right-left along a random Bezier curve.

We trained MoCoGAN on a [human action dataset](http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~vision/SpaceTimeActions.html) where content is represented by the performer, executing several actions. When fixing the content code and changing the motion code, it generated the same person performs different actions. When fixing the motion code and changing the content code, it generated different people performs the same action. Each pair of images represents the same action executed by different people:

We have collected a large-scale TaiChi dataset including 4.5K videos of TaiChi performers. Below are videos generated by MoCoGAN.
